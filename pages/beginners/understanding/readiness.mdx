# Readiness, Mindfulness

_It is the readiness of the mind that is wisdom._

But after we realize the emptiness of things, everything becomes real--not substantial. When we realize tjat everything we see is a part of emptiness, we can have no attachment to any existence; we realize that everything is just a tentative form and color. Thus we realize the true meaning of each tentative existence.

So whatever you do, or even though you do not do anything, enlightenment is there, always.

emptiness means everything is always here.

We have to think and to observe things without stagnation. We should accept things as they are without difficulty. Our mind should be soft and open enough to understand things as they are. When our thinking is soft, it is called imperturbable thinking. This kind of thinking is always stable.

Thinking which is divided in many ways is not true thinking. Concentration should be present in our thinking.

We just think with our whole mind, and see things as they are without any effort.
