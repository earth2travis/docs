# The Quality of Being

_When you do something, if you fix your mind on the activity with some confidence, the quality of your state of mind is the activity itself. When you are concentrated on the quality of your being, you are prepared for the activity._

"In calmness there should be activity; in activity there should be calmness."

The harmony is the quality of being.

When we do zazen, the quality of our calm, steady, serene sitting is the quality of the immense activity of being itself.

there is no connection between I myself yesterday and I myself in this moment;

"Charcoal does not become ashes."

when I say "you," there is no "I"; when I say "I," there is no "you." You are independent, and I am independent; each exists in a different moment. But this does not mean wee are quite different beings. We are actually one and the same being. We are the same, and yet different.

So before you do something, "being" is there, the result is there.

"There is no body and no mind!"

Because you think you have body or mind, you have lonely feelings, but when you realize that everything is just a flashing into the vast universe, you become very strong, and your existence becomes very meaningful.
