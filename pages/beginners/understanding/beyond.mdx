# Beyond Consciousness

_To realize pure mind is your delusion is practice. If you try to expel the delusion it will only persist the more. Just say, "Oh, this is just delusion," and do not be bothered by it._

Actually, good and bad is not the point. Whether or not you make yourself peaceful is the point, and whether or not you stick to it.

The best way towards perfect composures is to forget everything.

When you just observe the delusion, you have your true mind, your calm, peaceful mind.

Just to sit, that is enough.
