# Attachment, Nonattachment

_That we are attached to some beauty is also Buddha's activity._

The same thing is sometimes called nighttime, sometimes called daytime. They are one thing.

Zazen practice and everyday activity are one thing. We call zazen everyday life, and everyday life zazen.

So in activity there should be calmness, and in calmness there should be activity. Calmness and activity are not different.

Oneness is valuable, but variety is also wonderful.

We should find the reality in each moment, and in each phenomenon.

Love and hate are one thing. We should not attach to love alone. We should accept hate.

"To learn something is to know yourself; to study Buddhism is to study yourself." To learn something is not to acquire something which you did not know before. You know something before you learn it.

We do not emphasize anything. All we want to do is to know things just as they are.

"A flower falls, even though we love it; and a weed grows, even though we do not love it." Even though it is so, this is our life.

We should accept things just as they are. This is how we understand everything, and how we live in this world.

Emotionally we have many problems, but these problems are not actual problems; they are something created; they are problems pointed out by our self-centered ideas or views. Because we point out something, there are problems. But actually it is not possible to point out anything in particular. Happiness is sorrow; sorrow is happiness. There is happiness in difficulty; difficulty in happiness. Even though the ways we feel are different, they are not really different; in essence they are the same. This is the true understanding transmitted from Buddha to us.
