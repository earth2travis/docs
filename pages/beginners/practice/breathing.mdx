# Breathing

_What we call "I" is just a swinging door which moves when we inhale and when we exhale._

If you think, "I breathe," the "I" is extra. There is no you to say "I".

Here there is no idea of time or space.

Good an bad are only in your mind.

All that we should do is just do something as it comes.

We should live in this moment.

When we become truly ourselves, we just become a swinging door, and we are purely independent of, and at the same time, dependent on everything.

This kind of activity is the fundamental activity or the universal being.
