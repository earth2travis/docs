# Mind Waves

_Because we enjoy all aspects of life as an unfolding of big mind, we do not care for any excessive joy. So we have imperturbable composure._

and if you are not bothered by the waves, gradually they will become calmer and calmer.

It will take quite a long time before you find your calm, serene mind in your practice.

Nothing outside yourself can cause any trouble. You yourself make the waves in your mind.

it is with this imperturbably composure of big mind that we practice zazen.
