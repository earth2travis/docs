# No Dualism

_To stop your mind does not mean to stop the activities of mind. It means your mind pervades your whole body. With your full mind you form the mudra in your hands._

So "form is emptiness, and emptiness is form" is still dualistic.

To stop your mind does not mean to stop the activities of mind.

When the restrictions you have do not limit yoou, this is what we mean by practice.

If it really does not matter, there is no need for you even to say so.

But if you make your best effort just to continue your practice with your whole mind and body, without gaining ideas, then whatever you do will be true practice.
