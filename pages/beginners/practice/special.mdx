# Nothing Special

_If you continue this simple practice every day, you will obtain some wonderful power. Before you attain it, it is something wonderful, but after you attain it, it is nothing special._

When you give up, when you no longer want something, or when you do not try to do anything special, then you do something.

You may call it by many names, but for the person who has it, it is nothing, and it is something.

The most important thing is to express your true nature in the simplest, most adequate way and to appreciate it in the smallest existence.

Do not think about anything.
