# Mind Weeds

_You should rather be grateful for the weeds you have in your mind, because eventually they will enrich your practice._

So even though you have some difficulty in your practice, even though you have some waves while you are sitting, those waves themselves will help you.

We must have the actual experience of how our weeds change into nourishment.
