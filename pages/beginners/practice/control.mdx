# Control

_To give your sheep or cow a large, spacious meadow is the way to control him._

The reason everything looks beautiful is because it is out of balance, but its background is always in perfect harmony.

The best way to control people is to encourage them to be mischievous.

If you want to obtain perfect calmness in your zazen, you should not be bothered by the various images you find in your mind. Let them come, and let them go.

The only effort that will help you is to count your breathing, or to concentrate on your inhaling and exhaling.

The true purpose is to see things as they are, to observe things as they are, and to let everything go as it goes.

You should follow the rules of practice and your study should become more subtle and careful.

Time constantly goes from past to present and from present to future.

But perfect freedom is not found, without some rules.
