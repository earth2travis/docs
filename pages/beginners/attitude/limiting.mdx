# Limiting Your Activity

_Usually when someone believes in a particular religion, his attitude becomes more and more a sharp angle pointing away from himself. In our waythe point of the angle is always toward ourselves._

"A clay Buddha cannot cross water; a bronze Buddha cannot get through a furnace; a wooden Buddha cannot get through fire."

The way to practice without having any goal is to limit your activity, or to be concentrated on what you are doing in this moment.

Our practice has nothing to do with some particular religious belief.

In our way the point of the sharp angle is always towards ourselves, not away from ourselves.
