# Zen and Excitement

_Zen is not some kind of excitement, but concentration on our usual everyday routine._

It is necessary for us to keep the constant way.

If possible, try to be always calm and joyful and keep yourself from excitement.

But if we become interested in some excitement, of in our own change, we will become completely involved in our busy life, and we will be lost.

Do not be too interested in Zen.

Just continue in your calm, ordinary practice and you character will be built up.

The driver knows how much load the ox can carry, and he keeps the ox from being overloaded.

when your practice is calm and ordinary, everyday life itself is enlightenment.
