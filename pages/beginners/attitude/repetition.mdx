# Repetition

_If you lose the spirit of repetition, your practice will become quite difficult._

How flour becomes bread when put in the oven was for Buddha the most important thing.

In order to find out how dough became perfect bread, he made it over and over again, until he became quite successful.

So the kind of practice we stress thus cannot become too idealistic.

Just to practice zazen and put ourselves into the oven in our way.
