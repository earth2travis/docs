# To Polish a Tile

_When you become you, Zen becomes Zen. When you are you, you see things as they are, and you become one with your surroundings._

A frog also sits like us, but he has no idea of zazen.

"How is it possible to make a tile a jewel?"

"How is it possible to become a Buddha by practicing zazen?"

"Do you want to attain Buddhahood? There is not Buddhahood besides your ordinary mind. When a cart does not go, which do you whip, the cart of the horse?"

When you are you, then no matter what you do, that is zazen.

The problem is you yourself. It this is so, there is no problem.

Most people live in delusion, involved in their problem, trying to solve their problem.

So if you yourself have true practice, then everything else is practicing our way at the same time.

When you are you, you see things as they are, and you become one with your surroundings.
