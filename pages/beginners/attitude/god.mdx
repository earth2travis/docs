# God Giving

_"To give is nonattachment," that is, just not to attach to anything is to give._

Every existence in nature, every existence in the human world, every cultural work that we create, is something which was given, or is being given to us, relatively speaking.

If given in the spirit of nonattachment, the material offering and the teaching offering have the same value.

Not to be attached to something is to be aware of its absolute value. Everything you do should be based on such an awareness, and not on material of self-centered ideas of value.

When we emerge from nothing, when everything emerges from nothing, we se it all as a fresh new creation.

Everything creates some problems.

And we should forget, day by day, what we have done; this is true nonattachment. And we should do something new. To do something new, of course we must know our past, and this is all right. But we should not keep holding on to anything we have done; we should only reflect on it.
