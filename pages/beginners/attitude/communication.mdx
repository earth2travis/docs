# Communication

_Without any intentional, fancy way of adjusting yourself, to express yourself as you are is the most important thing._

Through your master's language, you understand more than what his words actually say.

By ultimate fact we do not mean something eternal or something constant, we mean things as they are in each moment.

But only by the actual practice of Zen can you experience reality directly and understand in their true sense the various statements made by your teacher of by Buddha.

In Zen we put emphasis on demeanor, or behavior.

You should be true to your feelings, and to your mind, expressing yourself without any reservations.

When you listen to someone, you should give up all your preconceived ideas and your subjective opinions; you should just listen to him, just observe what his way is. We put very little emphasis on right and wrong or good and bad. We just see things as they are with him, and accept them.

without understanding the spirit behind the words. This kind of danger is always there.

A mind full of preconceived ideas, subjective intentions, or habits is not open to things as they are.

to express yourself freely as you are is the most important thing to make yourself happy, and to make others happy.

True communication depends upon our being straightforward with one another.
