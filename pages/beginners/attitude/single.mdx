# Single-Minded Way

_Even if the sun were to rise from the west, the Bodhisattva has only one way._

Of course, whatever we do is unusual, because our life itself is so unusual. Buddha said, "To appreciate your human life is as rare as soil on your fingernail."

Our way is not to sit to acquire something; it is to express our true nature.

If you want to express yourself, your true nature, there should be some natural and appropriate way of expression.

You should allow yourself plenty of time; you should work on it with nothing in your mind, and without expecting anything.

This is also an expression of our sincerity, a part of our practice.

Whatever you do, it should be an expression of the same deep activity.

There is not starting point, no goal, nothing to attain.

There is no need for the passengers to be curious about the track.

There is no need to remember what I say; there is no need to understand what I say.
