# Constancy

_People who know the state of emptiness will always be able to dissolve their problems by constancy._

Instead of gathering knowledge, you should clear your mind. If your mind is clear, true knowledge is already yours.

If you are ready to accept things as they are, you will recieve them as old friends, even though you appreciate them with new feeling.

If you want to appreciate something fully, you should forget yourself.

There is always a possibility of understanding as long as we exist in the utter darkness of the sky, as long as we live in emptiness.

You must force yourself to be patient, but in constancy there is no particular effort involved--there is only the unchanging ability to accept things as they are.

Even if the flashing of enlightenment comes, our practice fogets all about it. Then it is ready for another enlightenment.
