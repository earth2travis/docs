# Epilogue: Zen Mind

_Before the rain stops we can hear a bird. Even under the heavy snow we see snowdrops and some new growth._

The main point is to practice seriously, and the important attitude is to understand and have confidence in big mind.

You cannot project yourself as some objective thing to think about.

Reality cannot be caught by thinking or feeling mind. Moment after moment to watch your breathing, to watch your posture, is true nature.

Enlightenment experience is to figure out, to understand, to realize this mind which is always with us and which we cannot see.

If we become too serious we will lose out way. If we are playing games we will lose our way.

If it is too strict you will fail, if it is too loose, the rules will not work.

The only way to study pure mind is through practice.

That you can do it in this moment means you can always do it.

Whatever you do should be the direct experience of Buddha nature.

We must have beginner's mind, free from possessing anything, a mind that knows everything is in flowing change. Nothing exists but momentarily in its present form and color. One thing flows into another and cannot be grasped.
